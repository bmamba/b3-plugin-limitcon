This plugin is testet for Urban Terror 4.1 and will be needless for 4.2 hopefully.

I noticed that some players have a new GUID every time they connect (same name,
but other GUID). This players were identificated as cheaters or at least their
behaviour were fishy. For me it seems that there exists cheats which change the
GUID at every connection. That's why I wrote this small plugin.

LimitCon checks how often the name of a connecting player was used, but it
counts only players which connected with their GUID only once. If this number
is higher as the threshold defined in the xml file, the player get banned for
some time (defined in the xml file also)
